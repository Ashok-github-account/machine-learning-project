1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Heart Disease UCI data
3. Data processing using pandas dataframe
4. visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Feature Selection 
	- Recursive Feature Elimination with Linear Regression - RFE
	- SequentialFeatureSelector with KNN - SFS
	- Without Feature Selection
6. Building the model
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree - J48
	- MLP-ANN
	- SMO - LinearSVC
	- Gradient Boosting Classifier
	- LDA - Linear Discriminant Classifier
	- KNN
	- XGBoost
	- Voting Classifier ( SVM + DT + RF)
7. Training the model
8. Building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better score comparing with Other Models 
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. Importing the packages
11. User gives input as Feature Values 
12. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
13. Trained model is used for prediction
14. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension:
In the base paper, the author mentioned few Machine Learning,Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier 100 and 99.4%, 
As an extension we have applied Voting Classifier and XGBoost Classifier, in which Voting Classifier and XGBoost also got 100% 
So with the Voting Classifier we build the model that is used for predicting the results.
